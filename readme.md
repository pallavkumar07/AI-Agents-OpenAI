# Build AI Agents From Scratch with Python

Welcome to the official repository for the course [**"Build AI Agents From Scratch with Python"**](https://learnwithhasan.com/learn/build-ai-agents/), a comprehensive guide designed to empower you to create autonomous AI agents using Python and ReAct Prompting. This course is perfect for anyone passionate about AI and eager to learn how to develop intelligent agents from the ground up.


In this dynamic course, you will be introduced to the fascinating world of AI agents. You will start with the basics and gradually move to more advanced concepts, using ReAct Prompting to enable large language models (LLMs) to take actionable steps. 

By the end of the course, you will have the skills to build AI agents that can intelligently respond to user queries and interact with the world.


- **Fundamentals of AI Agents**: Understand what AI agents are and how they operate.
- **ReAct Prompting**: Learn to use this innovative technique to make AI agents think and act.
- **Development from Scratch**: Build AI agents without the need for third-party libraries or tools.
- **Integration with External Data and APIs**: Extend the functionality of your agents to use live data and external APIs.
- **Practical Applications**: Create both simple and complex AI agents that can be applied in real-world scenarios.
